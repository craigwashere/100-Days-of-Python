# 100 Days of Python
 Online course of 100 days creating Python apps

Missing days are "interactive" through 'Coding Rooms' or 'Auditorium' unless otherwise specified
Day 18:		day_18.py has to functions: create a random path and create a spirograph of random colors
		hirst.py recreates Hirst dot painting with Turtle

Day 19:		turtle race

Day 20:		'snake' game with Python turtles

Day 22:		Pong with Python turtles

Day 23:		Frogger type game with Python turtles

Day 24:		This is a template letter generator using one file for the names and another for the letter template. output files are stored in separate files according to names.

Day 28:		This is a windowed application for work/break scheduling. It uses tkinter for the window API and displays a tomato for some reason.

Day 29:		Day 29 is a password generator with a tkinter GUI and saves with corresponding website and email address in a text file. Probably not the best way to store passwords, but for learning a Python GUI, fairly functional.

Day 31:		Day 31 is a language learning app to learn vocabulary in a foreign language, French in this case. The words to learn are read from a .csv file using Pandas and displayed with tkinter GUI. The basic idea is to provide feedback as to which words were remembered correctly, the ones remembered correctly are removed from the master list and stored in a separate file when the app closes. When the app reopens, it looks for the words to learn file, if not found, loads the default list. Got some neat images for correct/incorrect.

day 34:		Day 34 concludes the quiz program, but marks the first time using Python requests to retrieve data from a URL. While the application is a trivia game, it does demonstrate higher level software ideas including classes. Again, UI is handled through tkinter and mostly contained in the UI class.

day 35:		This app requests weather information from an online source and uses an email API to send and email to me regarding the weather. I hadn't setup an email client at the time of completing this.

day 38:		Day 38 is an exercise tracker that uses nutritionix and sheety APIs. The Nutritionix API gets calorie count. Sheety API updates Google Sheets.

Day 44:		introduction to web page development, building a static web page in HTML and CSS.

Day 45:		uses beautifulSoup to scrape data from a webpage and write the results in a file. This script gets the 'top 100 must watch movies' from an archived version of empireonline.com
